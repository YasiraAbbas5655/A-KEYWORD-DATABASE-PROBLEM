Think small  Note that the robot tour counter examples I presented boiled
down to six points or less, and the scheduling counter-examples to only three
intervals. This is indicative of the fact that when algorithms fail, there is
usually a very simple example on which they fail. Amateur algorists tend
to draw a big messy instance and then stare at it helplessly. The pros look
carefully at several small examples, because they are easier to verify and
reason about.
